2@94/2@01/02/1994@Any 3+ syllable Complex that is CVC initial AND the C/C is a permissible initial must be 'y' hyphenated. The Slinkui test is vacated, and Tosmabru is replaced by this. Eg: 'paslinkui' -> 'pasylinkui' while the currently prohibitted '*tosmabru' -> 'tosymabru'.@Syllables@SC
3@No double vowels in borrowings@01/01/2013@Doubled vowels (which require one to be stressed) are prohibited from Borrowings so they can be attached to Complexes without problems. Only 'alkooli' -> 'alkoholi' is affected.@Doubled Vowels@DV
