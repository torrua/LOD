# LOD - Loglan Dictionary

### Description
The original database was created decades ago, therefore it contains many typos and spelling errors. In this regard, it was decided to fix them all. 
Also it is necessary to add new words and update the definitions of current ones as the language evolves.
Our goal is to create a place to store the latest version of the Loglan dictionary with the ability to track changes.

### Repository
This repository contains text files with data from the Loglan dictionary. The output format is the Access database (mdb).
